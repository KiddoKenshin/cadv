# CADV
Canvas ADV game engine

CADV is a Visual Novel engine? featuring HTML5 Canvas.
Compare to BADV-TRE (which also far from finish), 
it lacks of many features too.

Currently the screen refresh / draw part is being focused.
It lacks of auto script execution, auto resource loader, Web Audio API support,
KAG(KiriKiri) compatibility, etc...

Please feel free to fork / contribute.
